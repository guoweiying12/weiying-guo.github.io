Welcome! I'm Weiying Guo, a passionate and dedicated professional in the field of Mathematics, currently deepening my expertise with a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Melbourne. With a strong foundation in advanced mathematical concepts, evidenced by my Master's in Mathematics and Statistics (with Distinction) from the same esteemed university, I bring a blend of academic rigor and practical application to the table. Here is a copy of my [cv](/notes/CV_for_math-4.pdf). 

Recently I have ongoing projects with my supervisor Assoicate Professor Michael Wheeler and Dr Sasha Garbali. The study is on rational function of the Izergin--Korepin model.

I have many notes starting from Linear algebra and goes to representation theory
- Linear algebra ([notes](/notes/Algebra.pdf)).
- Enumerative Combinatroics ([notes](/notes/Enmurative_Combinatroics.pdf)).
- Quantum group and representation theory ([notes](/notes/Quantum_group_and_Crystal_bases.pdf)).

# Journey

My journey in mathematics and academia has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to sharing it. As a casual tutor at both the University of Melbourne and The University of Queensland, I have honed my skills in conveying complex ideas with clarity and precision, assisting students across various levels.

# Current interest

My interests lie at the intersection of Mathematics and Combinatorics, where I delve into the complexities of data and algorithms. This is complemented by my proficiency in computing with Mathematica, problem-solving in R language, and developing robust mathematical models and algorithms.

Here on my site, you'll find insights into my professional journey, my academic endeavors, and my thoughts on the ever-evolving world of data science and mathematics. Whether you're a fellow academic, a student seeking guidance, or just curious about the world of mathematics, you'll find a wealth of information and resources here.

Let's explore the fascinating world of numbers and data together!

# Master thesis

I obtained my master's degree under the supervision of Professor Arun Ram ([here](http://math.soimeme.org/~arunram/)). My master's thesis can be found ([here](Master_thesis.pdf)). During my Master's project, I mainly focused on studying the ring of symmetric functions and its properties. Furthermore, I devoted most of my time to working on the theory of Macdonald polynomials. In particular, I explored combinatorial formulas used to compute Macdonald polynomials, such as the Haiman–Haglund–Loehr formula and the Ram–Yip formula. I am especially interested in developing new formulas for the type $$ GL_N $$ Macdonald polynomials. Recently, my work has shifted more towards integrable lattice models, which also provide interesting formulas for the type $$ GL_N $$ Macdonald polynomials.
